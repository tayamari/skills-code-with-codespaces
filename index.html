  <h1>Someone I Admire</h1>
  <h2 class="talley">
Jasmine Talley
  </h2>
  <p>
    Jasmine Talley goes by "Talley" to the public. She is a comedian, works for public officials, and co-host of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jokes-on-you-podcast/id1498551887">Jokes On You Podcast</a>. I admire her because she is very courageous, she speaks her mind, and is also vulnerable with her audience about her experiences and struggles. As a woman, she's empowering to listen to. She is unapologetic about not letting others, especially men, walk all over her. She'll call you out in one quick second, but have compassion exactly when and where needed. She's authentic and bold, and those are qualities I admire and strive to cultivate in myself on the day to day.

  <p>Other figures I admire are:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Taryn Delanie Smith
        Tiffani Singleton
        Kamie Crawford
        Hannah Beachler
        Ruth E. Carter
      </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2 class="reason">These figures influence my positivity, fashion style, and also work ethic and career in one shape or another.</h2>
